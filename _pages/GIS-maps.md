**Welcome :)**

This site is an online portfolio to document my journey through the exciting world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I began this journey from 2018 since I started worked GIS and CAD tools in urban planning. Until now, I have already finished my master's degree in Geo-Information Science and am continue discovering the GIS world.

I hope you will enjoy following my progress towards completion of the project. In the meantime, explore some of the projects that I have worked on in the past few years.
