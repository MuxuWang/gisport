About
=====

As a GISer from Wageningen University & Research, I specialize in geospatial development, extended reality (XR), and remote sensing technologies. With a strong foundation in technical skills, I'm passionate about utilizing these tools to solve complex geospatial challenges.


I'm actively seeking opportunities in GIS-related roles where I can apply my programming, 3D modeling, and spatial data analysis skills to contribute to impactful projects. Let's connect if you are looking for a highly motivated geospatial professional with a strong technical and analytical skill set!
