> A **confidential** student research project at [OnePlanet Research Center](https://www.oneplanetresearch.nl/).

 My research focused on developing an innovative tool for annotating LiDAR point cloud data in a virtual reality (VR) environment. By integrating auto-segmentation suggestions, the tool significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of point cloud annotation, offering a hands-on, immersive approach to processing complex spatial data. Whole project worked with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Cloud Compare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/), utilized **C#** for game engine development and **Python** for data processing and analysis .

The demostration of the project includes two parts:

1.The visualization of the digital orchard, using LiDAR data.

2.Automatic annotation tool with auto-segementation suggestion (pre-defined the catogories in Unity).
