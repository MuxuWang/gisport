A dynamic maps that shows the evolution in the levels of radiation in the Fukushima area from 2010 to 2021.
Maps were created by using [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) and [Adoble Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and the [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) was used to present project details to the stakeholders.

### **Project 2: Amsterdam center monumental building map**

</video>

This interactive map created by [Python](https://www.python.org/) retrieves [BAG](https://data.overheid.nl/en/dataset/basisregistratie-adressen-en-gebouwen--bag-) information about the monumental state of Dutch buildings on a national and municipal level and specifies whether a given building is positioned within the protected cityscape area.
Based on the year of construction retrieved from the Key Register of Adresses and Buildings, the repository assigns information about whether installation of a heating pump is allowed and/or recommended. The metadata and dataset were managed by [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-office) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

</video>

The video shows an interactive pdf created by [Adobe Acroba](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat.html)t with a mobilized form. The demostration provides an application which showcase the possible walking route with highest biodiversity rate. The route is in an interested area: Groenlo, where situated in the eastern part of the Netherlands, on the German border. 

Raster images preprocessed and downloaded from [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), and basic geospatial data analysis such as land use classification and route selection are conducted in [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview). The metadata and dataset were managed by [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-office), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) ,and **SQL**.

### **Project 4: 3D root web map**

</video>

This demo indicates a interactive map using [Cesium](https://cesium.com/) platform to illustrate the underground 3D tree root models with surrounding buildings and terrain model. Users could visualize the tree roots with traslucent terrain texture.

Geospatial datasets with register information for tree, water, underground pipes, soil were managed by [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) and [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/). Spatial data analysis and 3D root models process was implemented by [Python](https://www.python.org/) and **JavaScript**. The 3D tree root models were created by [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). And the metadata and dataset were managed by [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-office), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) ,and **SQL**.
